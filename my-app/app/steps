Aggie Nexus

⸻
🚀 Aggie Nexus  – Enhanced Project Context (Next.js MVP)
This is a Next.js web application called “Aggie Nexus” serving as a platform for Texas A&M University affiliates to connect, collaborate, and share opportunities. It uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase as the backend/database service.
⸻
🛠 Current Development Phase
The app is currently transitioning from a frontend-only MVP using mock data to a full-stack app that fetches real users and projects from a Supabase database.
✅ Currently Working:
* Projects successfully pulled from Supabase and displayed.
⚠️ Immediate Task (Highest Priority):
* Replace mock data in user view with real data from Supabase.
* Verify user data directly from the MCP Supabase server for correctness.
⸻
🔜 Major Updates (Upcoming)
After connecting users-view to the database, these updates will follow:
1. UI Overhaul aligned with formal brand guidelines
2. Full authentication (login, signup, password reset via Supabase Auth)
3. Profile editing functionality
4. Viewing detailed user profiles
5. Filtering and search for projects/users
6. Project creation/editing functionality
⸻
📦 Data Structures & Features
✅ Users:
* Full name, Email, Bio, Industry, Skills, Social/Professional Links
✅ Projects:
* Title, Description, Recruitment status, Skills needed, Location type
✅ Current Features:
* Bookmarking projects/users
* Viewing user profiles
* Viewing project details
⸻
⚠️ Mock Data Usage
Components currently still using mock data (primarily from lib/utils.ts and components/.tsx) must transition to real data fetching from Supabase via MCP tools.
⸻
🧑‍🎨 Design & Technical Stack
* Fonts: Montserrat, Playfair Display, Inter (Google Fonts)
* Next.js best practices: Server Components, React Hooks, Context for Auth state, Supabase client, SSR, TypeScript
* Styling: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
⸻
✅ Current Implementation Status
1. Database Schema: Supabase with tables (users, projects, bookmarks, events), proper relationships, constraints, and indexing
2. Authentication Framework: Supabase Auth (setup in lib/auth.tsx), middleware (lib/auth-middleware.ts), context provider
3. API Routes: (/api/users, /api/projects, /api/search/users, /api/bookmarks)
4. Models & Services: CRUD-ready User, Project, Bookmark, and Event models
5. UI Components: Navigation bar, cards, layout, theme provider, using shadcn/ui and Tailwind
⸻
❌ Areas Still Missing or Incomplete
Authentication UI
* Login/signup/password reset pages not yet implemented
*  currently shows mock user data
User Management
* Profile page and editing incomplete
* User search still using mock data
* Users listing needs real data from Supabase
Project Management
* Missing project creation/editing forms
* Project detail page incomplete
* Project search/filtering disconnected from database
Data Integration
* Replace mock data with actual Supabase data fetching
* Implement robust loading/error states for all data-fetching components
Additional Features
* Bookmarking functionality incomplete
* Event management features incomplete
* Messaging feature not implemented
Security
* Missing authorization checks, input validation, error handling, rate-limiting
⸻
🎯 Your Immediate Focus (Important)
Primary Task: Implement the users view to correctly pull user profiles from the Supabase MCP server instead of using mock data.
* Use Supabase Client SDK for data fetching (supabase-js)
* Validate and verify data directly using MCP-provided browser tools
* Confirm connection using filesystem-based MCP development servers and Supabase instance from MCP installer
⸻
🧑‍💻 Role & Expectations
You are:
* An expert full-stack developer
* Proficient in Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
* Focused on clear, readable, secure, bug-free code adhering to latest best practices
⸻
🧰 Technical Preferences
* Use kebab-case for files/components (e.g., user-card.tsx)
* Prefer React Server Components & Next.js SSR
* Use "use client" minimally and explicitly
* Always handle loading/error states for Supabase data fetching
* Include error handling and logging
* Verify data interactions with browser-based MCP debugging tools
* Validate integrations with filesystem-based MCP development server provided by MCP installer
* Write semantic, accessible HTML
⸻
✅ General Guidelines
* Strictly follow all requirements without assumptions
* Fully implement functionality (no placeholders or TODOs)
* Prioritize readability and correctness over performance
* Clearly reference filenames and paths in explanations
* Be concise yet comprehensive in your responses
* Explicitly state uncertainties—do not guess
⸻
Your immediate goal: Successfully transition the user-view from mock data to real-time Supabase data using MCP installer/server and validate using browser tools provided by the MCP ecosystem.
